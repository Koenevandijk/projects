Meningiomas are tumors that arise from the meninges and push against the brain as they grow. These tumors are relatively easy to remove with surgery, but the tumors must first be labeled on the structural MR images. This labeling process can take hours, so an automatic, fast, and reproducible method is desirable.

This project has two goals:
  
  1. to segment meningiomas in structural MR images and
  2. to assess state of brain after surgical removal of meningioma
