[Brainverse](https://github.com/ReproNim/brainverse) is an electronic laboratory notebook (an Electron desktop app), that is being developed to allow neuroimaging research to be carried out in a collaborative way and to curate data at the source making it reproducible. [NIDM-Results Data model](http://nidm.nidash.org/specs/nidm-results_130.html) is a structured and unified representation of neuroimaging results across analysis software.  

This project aims to develop javascript methods to read, parse, build a RDF graph and view a serialized NIDM-result OWL file in Brainverse.
