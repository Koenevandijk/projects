This first precept on hands on learning and other precepts (read the chapter) spurred the free and open source software movement; one that has given us GNU/Linux, Apache, and many other software we now use routinely.

Brainhack started with the intent to create a hacker community around the brain. The intent was not just to develop software, but to collaborate, to bring together art and science, and to support education and open science. Cameron Craddock, Pierre Bellec, Daniel Margulies, and others initiated and drove this change that has resulted in this [2017 Brainhack Global](http://events.brainhack.org/global2017/) event and a thriving community of brainhackers on the [Brainhack Slack team](https://brainhack-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/).

For people who have not been engaged with brainhacks in the past here are a few pointers.

## Who can attend
Anyone with the willingness to collaborate, to learn, to share, and to promote open science.

## How does it work
Each brainhack event is somewhat unique, but they typically take the form of an [unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference). Schedules are flexible and determined by participants. Participants use the time to work on a variety of projects, whether proposed by themselves or others. The events often have training lectures, whether planned or unplanned, and may have ignite talks to get people going. It is also a space to make new connections, form new collaborations, and learn about a diverse array of open information that Google search may not have returned.

## What can you do
You can participate in many ways. You can [propose a project](../submitting-projects), work on a project with someone, present your own work and interests, give a tutorial, and so on.
