# Brief description
The fMRI datasets were collected from a group of 24 native English speakers before and after they learned a month of a foreign language.
Two language tasks were collected at both times that allow analysis for longitudinal plasticity.

# Hack wish list

* convert DICOMS to BIDS format
* convert openfMRI to BIDS format (the project has been mostly organized in the openfMRI format): 
[openfmri2bids](https://github.com/INCF/openfmri2bids)
* first-level, second-level univariate analysis
* second-level multi-variate analysis (what pre-training fMRI features predict learning outcomes)

# Interested parties

* Zhenghan Qi
* Marthias Goncalves
* Smruti Padhy
* Yoel Sanchez Araujo
* Kevin Sitek
