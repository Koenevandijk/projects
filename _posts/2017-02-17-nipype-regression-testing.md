As more versions of neuroimaging software are released, subtle changes in one program's output can cause a butterfly effect in the later parts of analysis. This project hopes to set up a testing framework for many of [Nipype's](https://github.com/nipy/nipype) implemented interfaces to monitor any unplanned changes to the outputs.
