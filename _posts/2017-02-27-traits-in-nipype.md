[Nipype](https://github.com/nipy/nipype) uses the [Traits package](http://docs.enthought.com/traits/traits_user_manual/intro.html#what-are-traits),
that allows Python programmers to use a special kind of type definition called a trait, which gives object attributes some additional characteristics. 
This project will explore recent problems with the library and possibilities of moving from Traits library to the [Traitlets Python library].
